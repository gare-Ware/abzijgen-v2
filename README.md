# Abzijgen CBD
**In Progress*

A promotional website for a New Jersey startup CBD company. 

**Link to project:** https://fervent-pare-dbd0bb.netlify.app/

(coming soon page is live at custom domain until client is ready for full-site launch: https://abzijgen.com)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Client provided a label only which I used to generate SVG images of the different label/logo elements and design the site to mimic their brand. SVG elements were extracted from the logo via Adobe Illustrator. A mockup was rendered in Figma for the client's approval and most of the site was then built. I am currently waiting on data from the client (product images and details, in-store locations, etc.). Coming soon page was put up at the custom domain (abzijgen.com) months ago to begin spreading the word and collecting user input email addresses. Utilized SEO practices to achieve the top spot in Google search results.

## Lessons Learned:

Sometimes very limited data is provided by the client and some creativity is required to come up with a proper design. In this case the client provided a low-resolution product label and nothing more. I used this image to create the initial coming soon page, but I knew I wanted a more polished design for the full site. I was able to achieve this with Adobe Illustrator and the client was very happy with this. 

Also, working with a startup company can be a long-term commitment. The client is still working on many details of their product and so the site launch has been delayed.
